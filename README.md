# Pizza Data Analysis
---
## Overview

- This dataset contains analysis on Pizza in different cities and states of US.
- The dataset is downloaded from kaggle. Link is already given in the Jupyter file.
- Basics of Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas are touched in the dataset.
- Basic cleaning of Data and EDA is performed on the Dataset.
- Normal graphs are also plotted. However geo graphs can also be plotted using geopandas library but I have avoided it.
- Instead I have pasted some screenshots from Tableau for the same.

It is a snap of how data will look when we have used average price as size and colour constraint. It means bigger the bubble size, more costly pizza. We can also filter out based on States.

It is a snap when you don't want to filter out but instead highlight a particular State. usually done when comparison is done for other states as well as within a state. Here it is done for **NY**.

In this snap we are seeing the details for the Biggest bubble highlighted (For NY). Similary we can do for other states as well.

In general, we use visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI because they are far more easy and provide so many options for visualisation and generally don't need coding skills. 
All these visualization were done on Tableau.

NOTE: In order to plit similar graphs in python we can use geopandas, plotly libraries. However, these libraries might be a little overwhelming but are not harder to grasp. Specially GeoPandas.
